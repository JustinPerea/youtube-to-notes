# Research Prompt: Study Notes Optimization & Content-Type Detection

## Context
I'm building a YouTube video processing application that converts videos into various content formats using Gemini 2.5 Flash API. I need to optimize the Study Notes template and develop comprehensive content-type detection for different video genres.

## Current Study Notes Template Structure
Our current Study Notes template includes:
- Main Concepts and Definitions
- Key Points and Examples  
- Important Quotes or Statements
- Summary Points (Quick Reference)
- Timeline/Chronology
- Critical Analysis
- Vocabulary/Glossary
- Key Takeaways
- Questions for Further Study
- Related Topics to Explore
- Content-Adaptive Study Tips
- Learning Style Considerations (Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic)
- Memory Techniques
- Study Schedule Recommendations

## Research Objectives

### 1. Study Notes Format Optimization
**Research Question:** What are the most effective note-taking formats and structures for different types of educational content?

**Key Areas to Investigate:**
- **Academic Note-Taking Methods**: Cornell Notes, Mind Mapping, Outline Method, Charting Method, Sentence Method
- **Digital Note-Taking Best Practices**: Evernote, Notion, Obsidian, Roam Research patterns
- **Cognitive Science**: How note structure affects retention and recall
- **Learning Theories**: Constructivism, Cognitivism, Connectivism in note design
- **Educational Psychology**: Spacing effect, retrieval practice, elaboration in notes
- **Memory Techniques**: Spaced repetition, mnemonic devices, chunking strategies
- **Visual Design**: Typography, spacing, color coding, hierarchy in notes
- **Accessibility**: Universal design principles for note-taking

### 2. Content-Type Detection & Genre-Specific Notes
**Research Question:** How should we detect and adapt note formats for different video content types?

**Content Types to Analyze:**
- **Educational Content**: Lectures, tutorials, courses, seminars
- **Entertainment Content**: Movies, TV shows, music videos, comedy
- **Documentary Content**: Historical, scientific, cultural, biographical
- **Tutorial/How-To Content**: DIY, cooking, programming, crafts
- **News/Journalism**: Current events, investigative, opinion pieces
- **Technical Content**: Software demos, product reviews, technical explanations
- **Academic Content**: Research presentations, conferences, peer-reviewed studies
- **Creative Content**: Art tutorials, music analysis, film criticism

**Detection Methods to Research:**
- **Metadata Analysis**: Title, description, tags, channel type
- **Content Patterns**: Visual elements, speech patterns, pacing
- **Audience Indicators**: Comments, engagement metrics, subscriber base
- **Temporal Patterns**: Video length, structure, chapter markers
- **Genre Signatures**: Color palettes, music, editing styles

### 3. Adaptive Note Strategies
**Research Question:** How can we automatically adapt note formats based on content type?

**Adaptation Areas:**
- **Structure Flexibility**: Which sections to include/exclude per content type
- **Language Adaptation**: Formal vs. casual, technical vs. accessible
- **Depth Adjustment**: Surface-level vs. deep analysis based on content complexity
- **Focus Areas**: What to emphasize for different content types
- **Learning Objectives**: Different goals for different content (entertainment vs. education)

### 4. Learning Style Optimization
**Research Question:** How can we enhance the learning style sections for different content types?

**Research Areas:**
- **Visual Learners**: What visual elements work best for each content type?
- **Auditory Learners**: How to optimize audio-focused learning strategies?
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: What hands-on activities work for different content?
- **Reading/Writing Learners**: Text-based strategies for different genres
- **Social Learners**: Group study approaches for various content types

## Specific Research Tasks
