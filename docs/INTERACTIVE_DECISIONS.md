# Interactive Decision-Making in Agent Workflow

## Overview

Our agent workflow system now includes **interactive decision-making** capabilities that allow agents to ask clarifying questions before proceeding with implementation. This ensures that agents don't make assumptions and instead gather specific requirements from users.

## 🤔 Why Interactive Decisions?

### Problems with Assumption-Based Development
- **Missed Requirements**: Agents might implement features that don't match user expectations
- **Wasted Time**: Implementing the wrong approach requires rework
- **Poor User Experience**: Designs and functionality that don't align with user needs
- **Technical Debt**: Quick fixes that don't follow best practices

### Benefits of Interactive Decisions
- **Accurate Implementation**: Agents implement exactly what users want
- **Better Collaboration**: Users and agents work together from the start
- **Reduced Rework**: Fewer iterations needed to get the right result
- **Learning**: System learns user preferences over time

## 🔄 How It Works

### 1. Task Submission
```
User submits task → Coordinator analyzes → Agent generates questions → User provides answers → Implementation begins
```

### 2. Question Generation
Each agent type generates relevant questions based on the task:

#### Frontend Agent Questions
- **Design Style**: Glass morphism, modern minimalist, neumorphism, etc.
- **Layout Preferences**: Single-page, multi-page, card-based, dashboard-style
- **Accessibility Level**: Basic, enhanced, custom requirements
- **Performance Priority**: Maximum optimization, balanced, development speed
- **Component Purpose**: Data display, user input, navigation, feedback

#### Backend Agent Questions
- **API Structure**: REST, GraphQL, gRPC
- **Database Choice**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- **Authentication Method**: JWT, OAuth, custom
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis, in-memory, CDN
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive, basic, custom

#### Coding Agent Questions
- **Architecture Pattern**: MVC, MVVM, Clean Architecture
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests
- **Code Style**: Functional, OOP, mixed approach
- **Documentation Level**: Minimal, comprehensive, API docs only

### 3. Decision Processing
- **Validation**: Ensures all required questions are answered
- **Storage**: Decisions are stored for future reference
- **Context**: Decisions influence implementation approach
- **Learning**: System remembers user preferences

## 🎨 Design-Focused Example

### Frontend Agent Design Questions

When creating UI components, the Frontend Agent asks:

#### 1. Design Style Selection
```
Question: "What design style should we use for this interface?"
Type: Design
Description: "This will determine the visual approach, color schemes, and overall aesthetic."
Options:
- Modern Minimalist
- Glass Morphism
- Neumorphism
- Material Design
- Bauhaus
- Custom Style
```

#### 2. Layout Structure
```
Question: "What type of layout structure do you prefer?"
Type: Preference
Description: "This affects how content is organized and navigated."
Options:
- Single-page application with sections
- Traditional multi-page navigation
- Card-based grid layout
- Dashboard-style with sidebar
- Full-screen immersive
```

#### 3. Interactivity Level
```
Question: "How interactive should this component be?"
Type: Preference
Description: "This affects animations, hover states, and user feedback."
Options:
- Static (no animations)
- Subtle animations (hover effects)
- Moderate interactivity (transitions)
- Highly interactive (complex animations)
```

### Example: Glass Morphism Implementation

When user selects "Glass Morphism":

```css
.component {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
  border-radius: 16px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

.component:hover {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15);
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  box-shadow: 0 8px 40px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
}
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Question Types

```typescript
interface AgentQuestion {
  id: string;
  type: 'choice' | 'text' | 'image' | 'design' | 'technical' | 'preference';
  question: string;
  description?: string;
  options?: string[];
  required: boolean;
  context?: string;
  examples?: string[];
  followUpQuestions?: AgentQuestion[];
}
```

### Decision Storage

```typescript
interface AgentDecision {
  questionId: string;
  answer: string | string[] | any;
  reasoning?: string;
  impact?: string[];
}
```

### Workflow Integration

```typescript
// Agent generates questions
const questions = await agent.generateQuestions(task);

// User provides decisions
const decisions: AgentDecision[] = [
  {
    questionId: 'design-style',
    answer: 'Glass Morphism',
    reasoning: 'Want modern, elegant look',
    impact: ['Adds glass morphism CSS', 'Requires backdrop-filter']
  }
];

// Agent processes decisions and continues
const result = await agent.executeTaskWithDecisions(task, decisions);
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Users

#### 1. Provide Context
```
Good: "I want a landing page that converts visitors into users"
Better: "I want a landing page that converts visitors into users. 
Our target audience is developers aged 25-40 who work with AI tools."
```

#### 2. Consider Trade-offs
- **Speed vs Quality**: Faster development vs better user experience
- **Simplicity vs Features**: Clean interface vs comprehensive functionality
- **Cost vs Performance**: Budget constraints vs optimal performance

#### 3. Think Long-term
- **Scalability**: Will this solution grow with your needs?
- **Maintainability**: Can the team easily modify and extend?
- **Consistency**: Does it match your overall design system?

### For Agents

#### 1. Ask Specific Questions
```
Bad: "What design do you want?"
Good: "What design style should we use? Options include glass morphism 
for a modern feel, minimalist for clean aesthetics, or material design 
for Google-like consistency."
```

#### 2. Provide Examples
- Include visual examples when possible
- Link to reference implementations
- Show before/after comparisons

#### 3. Explain Impact
- How does each choice affect development time?
- What are the performance implications?
- What maintenance considerations exist?
