## üö® Critical Security Issues to Fix

### High Priority
1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all secrets are properly configured
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement to prevent abuse
3. **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs
4. **Error Handling**: Don't leak sensitive information
5. **CORS Configuration**: Restrict cross-origin requests

### Medium Priority
1. **Content Security Policy**: Implement CSP headers
2. **Security Headers**: Add security headers to responses
3. **Monitoring**: Set up security monitoring
4. **Logging**: Implement secure logging
5. **Backup**: Set up data backup procedures

## üîß Automated Security Checks

### 1. Dependency Vulnerability Scan
```bash
npm audit
npm audit fix
```

### 2. Code Security Analysis
```bash
# Install security tools
npm install -g snyk
snyk test
```

### 3. Environment Variable Check
```bash
# Check for hardcoded secrets
grep -r "password\|secret\|key\|token" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.jsx" . | grep -v "node_modules" | grep -v ".git"
```

### 4. SSL/TLS Check
```bash
# Check SSL configuration
curl -I https://your-domain.vercel.app
```

## üìã Pre-Launch Security Review

### Before Going Public
1. **Penetration Testing**: Consider professional security audit
2. **Legal Review**: Ensure compliance with privacy laws
3. **User Testing**: Test with real users for security issues
4. **Documentation**: Document security procedures
5. **Incident Response**: Plan for security incidents

### Ongoing Security
1. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
2. **Security Monitoring**: Monitor for suspicious activity
3. **User Feedback**: Listen to security concerns
4. **Security Training**: Train team on security best practices
5. **Incident Response**: Have procedures for security incidents
