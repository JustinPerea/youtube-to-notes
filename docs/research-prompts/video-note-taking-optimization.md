# Video Note-Taking Optimization Research Prompt

## Research Objective
Investigate and develop optimal strategies for taking notes from video content, with particular focus on:
1. Content-type detection and adaptive note formats
2. Cognitive load optimization for different video genres
3. Template-based approaches for consistent, high-quality output
4. Integration with AI video analysis capabilities

## Research Context

### Current State
We have a YouTube video processing application that:
- Uses Google Gemini 2.0 Flash API for video analysis
- Detects video content types (tutorial, lecture, documentary, etc.)
- Generates different note formats (Basic Summary, Study Notes, Presentation Slides)
- Has issues with conversational language in outputs

### Target Video Content Types
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step instructions, how-to guides
- **Lectures**: Academic content, educational material
- **Documentaries**: Factual information, research-based content
- **Podcasts**: Conversational discussions, interviews
- **Product Demos**: Feature explanations, software tutorials
- **Webinars**: Professional presentations, business content

## Research Questions

### 4. Template Engineering
- What are the essential components for each note type?
- How can templates be flexible while maintaining structure?
- What role do visual hierarchy and formatting play?
- How can we ensure templates scale across different video lengths?

### 5. AI Integration Strategies
- How can we leverage AI's video understanding capabilities for better note-taking?
- What prompts work best for different content types?
- How can we ensure AI outputs are consistent and non-conversational?
- What quality control measures are most effective?
